# AI_MinMax_Adversarial_Search
## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of X-O (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) using AI MinMax adversarial search algorithm. The game is designed to be played in a web browser and allows you to play against an AI opponent that uses the MinMax algorithm to make optimal moves.

## Features
- Play X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe) against an AI opponent.
- AI opponent uses the MinMax algorithm to make strategic moves.
- User-friendly interface with interactive gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the game board and user interface.
- CSS: Styling and layout of the game interface.
- JavaScript: Game logic and AI implementation.
- MinMax Algorithm: AI decision-making strategy.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.

2. You will be playing as "X" and the AI opponent will be playing as "O".

3. Click on an empty cell to make your move. The AI opponent will then make its move.

4. The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.

## AI MinMax Algorithm

The AI opponent uses the MinMax algorithm to determine the best move in a given game state. The MinMax algorithm explores all possible moves and their outcomes, assigning scores to each move. It then selects the move that maximizes its score while minimizing the player's score. This ensures that the AI opponent makes optimal decisions to either win or force a draw.
